Caricature - a friendship between moq and amok
===========================================

This project aims to make interop between IronRuby objects and .NET objects easier.
The idea is that it integrates nicely with bacon and later rspec and that it transparently lets you mock ironruby ojbects
as well as CLR objects/interfaces.

Currently looking into creating proxies for objects.
